# Molecular-dynamics-using-openmp-and-simd


Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation is a well-progressed numerical method that shows the use of a 
suitable algorithm to solve the classical equations of motion for atoms relating with a known inter atomic potential. 
MD simulation techniques are also well suited for studying surface phenomena,
as they give a qualitative explanation of surface structure and dynamics.


 
OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) that 
supports multiplatform memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran, 
on most platforms, instruction set architectures and operating systems, including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, and Windows. 
It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behaviour.
